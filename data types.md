data types in javascript:
  1.primitive data types:
primitive data types are simple,less complicated , they are not objects and do not have methods
examples of primitive data types are:
  1.number
  2.string
  3.boolean
  4.null
  5.undefined

  e.g.,let name="antara";
      let age=19;
      let isStudent=true;
      let score=null;
      let id=symbol("unique");

  2.reference data types:
  reference data types stores the memory address of the actual object they dont hold the data directly but rather point to it
  exampls of reference data type:-
  1.class
  2.object
  3.array

  e.g., let obj={name:"antara"};
  let arr=[1,2,3];
  let func=function(){ return "hi";};

  -Difference between primitive and reference data types:-
      the difference comes in when the computer has to store a reference data type.when you create a variable and assign it a value that is a reference data type,the computer does not directly store that data type in that variable.
