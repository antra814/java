Array Destructing Is :
We Unpack whole array which is huge with data
And 
data can be values or properties
from
arrays or objects respectively

we assign it to distinct particular variables.

-array destructing is a concise way to unpack values from arrays into separate variables.

-syntax
         let [a , b] = [10 , 20];
         consol.log(a);
         consol.log(b);

-destructing with more values
        let [x, y, z] = [1, 2, 3];   
        consol.log(z);
              
-Array is Destructed and stored in variables
 and variable act similar to normal var.
