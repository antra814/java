-null is a special primitive value that represents "nothing".
-it means the variable is intentionally empty or has no object value.

use of null:-
when you want to reset a variable.
you want to show that a variables has no  values yet,but will get one later.


let person=null;

consol.log(person);

consol.log(typeof person);

-typeof null returns the object its not an object.
this is bug in javascript.
